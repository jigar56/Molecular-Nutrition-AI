## üß† **Enhanced AI Responses**

### **Before vs After:**

#### **Before (Basic):**
```
"Eat more protein for muscle gain"
```

#### **After (Molecular-Level):**
```
"Complete Protein Optimization: Your protein intake is below optimal levels. 
Proteins provide 9 essential amino acids needed for muscle synthesis, enzyme 
production, and hormone regulation. Complete proteins contain all essential 
amino acids in optimal ratios for maximum biological value. Based on your 
health goals and current intake, increasing complete protein sources will 
support muscle maintenance, recovery, and overall cellular function. 
Protein synthesis requires adequate energy and micronutrients.

Suggested Foods: Quinoa (1 cup cooked), Hemp seeds (3 tbsp), Lentils (1 cup cooked), 
Chia seeds (2 tbsp), Tempeh (4 oz)

Target Nutrients: Complete Proteins, Essential Amino Acids, Leucine"
```
