## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Method 1: Test with Random Data (Quick Test)**
1. Open `http://localhost:5176/` (or whatever port is shown)
2. Click the **"🧪 Test with Random Data"** button
3. Should automatically complete profile setup and redirect to dashboard
4. Check browser console for success logs

### **Method 2: Manual Form Testing**
1. **Step 1 - Basic Info**:
   - Age: Enter any number (e.g., 25)
   - Sex: Select from dropdown
   - Ethnicity: Select from dropdown
   - Region: Select from dropdown
   - Click "Next"

2. **Step 2 - Health & Lifestyle**:
   - Select dietary lifestyle (e.g., "Vegan")
   - Select medical history (or "None")
   - Click "Next"

3. **Step 3 - Health Goals**:
   - **IMPORTANT**: Select at least one health goal
   - Click "Complete Setup"

### **Method 3: Debug Console Testing**
Open browser console (F12) and look for these logs:

```
=== LOADING INITIAL DATA ===
Loaded profile from localStorage: null
=== INITIAL DATA LOADED ===
```

When clicking "Complete Setup":
```
Complete Setup button clicked
Selected goals: ['muscle_gain', 'energy_boost']
Form data: {age: 25, sex: 'female', ...}
=== FORM SUBMISSION STARTED ===
Form data: {...}
Selected goals: [...]
Current step: 3
Final profile data: {...}
Calling onComplete...
=== PROFILE COMPLETION TRIGGERED ===
Profile data received: {...}
Profile object created: {...}
Calling saveUserProfile...
useAppState: Saving profile to localStorage: {...}
useAppState: Profile saved to localStorage
useAppState: Profile state updated
Profile saved successfully!
=== FORM SUBMISSION COMPLETED ===
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If "Complete Setup" Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for error messages
   - Verify all required fields are filled
   - Ensure at least one health goal is selected

2. **Try Test Button**:
   - Click "🧪 Test with Random Data" button
   - This bypasses form validation and uses hardcoded data

3. **Clear Browser Data**:
   - Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5

4. **Check Form State**:
   - Open browser console
   - Type: `document.querySelector('form').checkValidity()`
   - Should return `true`

### **If Import Error Persists:**

1. **Clear Cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check Browser**:
   - Use Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
   - Disable browser extensions
   - Try incognito mode

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **After Successful Profile Setup:**
- ✅ Redirected to Dashboard page
- ✅ User profile saved in localStorage
- ✅ All navigation working
- ✅ Can access Food Log, AI Insights, Progress pages

### **After Using Test Button:**
- ✅ Immediate redirect to Dashboard
- ✅ Profile created with random data:
  - Age: 25
  - Sex: Female

  - Lifestyle: Vegan
  - Health Goals: Muscle Gain, Energy Boost

## 🚀 **Next Steps After Profile Setup**
