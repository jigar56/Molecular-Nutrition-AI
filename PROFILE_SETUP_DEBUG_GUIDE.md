## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Direct Save Test Works But Form Doesn't:**

1. **Check Form Validation**:
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Ensure at least one health goal is selected
   - Check console for validation errors

2. **Check Form Data**:
   - Verify `watch()` returns correct data
   - Check if `selectedGoals` and `selectedMedical` are populated

### **If Neither Test Works:**

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check if localStorage is available
   - Verify no CORS or security issues

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Ensure no network errors
   - Verify all resources load correctly

3. **Try Different Browser**:
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
   - Disable browser extensions
   - Try incognito mode

### **If Profile Saves But Doesn't Load:**

1. **Check localStorage**:
   - Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Look for `molecular-nutrition-user` key
   - Verify data is properly formatted JSON

2. **Check App State**:
   - Look for "Profile set in state" logs
   - Verify `setUserProfile` is called
   - Check if component re-renders
